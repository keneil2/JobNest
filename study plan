 second of may 
 the middle ware is acting weird I think it is bacause the I initailly set it up to redirect to the login page and it was supposed to handle request from that page hint start with chatgpt kl.
 #fixed the problem was that the laravel expects the dbname to be password and the name I had was pwd there were some other issue but I dont remember.
 next I need to implement an email in the input field and an column  also password resetting

 left this project for a while as you can see I need to revisted and try to understand 
 my thought process in this project thing  is i have learn alot more so seeing this code there are parts I would like to refactor 
 but first lets figure out how I sent emails 
 and what the right way to do start refactor the registration part of the web.
update:  SO I kind of refactor the code lol but I got around to understanding how the Mail thing works so thats good
